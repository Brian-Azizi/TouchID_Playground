# TouchID_Playground
A small React Native app to demonstrate how to integrate Touch ID into your authentication flow

I used this during my talk at the [React Native London meetup in March 2018](https://www.meetup.com/React-Native-London/events/248738739/).

Also published an article on the topic on the Theodo blog: https://blog.theodo.com/2018/04/add-touch-id-react-native-app/
